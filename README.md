1.Introduction

The Standard Reports and Letters (SRL) system helps users create different types of reports, SMS messages, emails, labels, and other documents (called letter types). Users can create these documents in the SRL screen and generate or print them using the **Generate** and **Print** options under the **Current** or **All** menus. These options are available from the section that organizes the letter types.

Every letter must be part of a **Standard Letter Group (SLG)** . Letters and reports are generated and printed from the sections where they are needed. For example, offer letters are generated from the decision entry screens, while course enrollment letters are generated from the Student Course Enrollment record. The letter group decides where the letter can be generated and which information fields can be included.
